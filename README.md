In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict the genres of movies based on their overviews, and also developed a basic recommender system to suggest movies based on user input.

## Natural Language Processing Concepts

Several natural language processing (NLP) concepts were used in this project, including:

### Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of breaking text into individual words or tokens. Here's an example of tokenization using the NLTK library:



```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')

text = "This is an example sentence."
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)

```

output:

```css
['This', 'is', 'an', 'example', 'sentence', '.']
```



### Stop Words

Stop words are common words that are often removed from text when doing NLP tasks. Here's an example of removing stop words using the NLTK library:



```python
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
nltk.download('stopwords')

text = "This is an example sentence."
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
filtered_tokens = [token for token in tokens if token.lower() not in stop_words]
print(filtered_tokens)

```

Output:



```css
['example', 'sentence', '.']
	
```



### Stemming

Stemming is the process of reducing words to their root form. Here's an example of stemming using the NLTK library:



```python
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer

text = "This is an example sentence."
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
stemmer = PorterStemmer()
stemmed_tokens = [stemmer.stem(token) for token in tokens]
print(stemmed_tokens)
```

print(stemmed_tokens)
```

Output:



```css
['thi', 'is', 'an', 'exampl', 'sentenc', '.']
```



### Named Entity Recognition

Named entity recognition (NER) is the process of identifying and classifying named entities in text. Here's an example of NER using the Spacy library:



```python
import spacy

text = "John Smith is a software engineer at Google."
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
doc = nlp(text)
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)
```



Output:

```css
John Smith PERSON
Google ORG
```

## Recommender Systems

Recommender systems are a type of machine learning model that suggest items (e.g. movies, products, songs) to users based on their past behavior or preferences. There are several types of recommender systems, including:

### Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering is a method of recommending items to users based on their similarity to other users. This method relies on the assumption that users who have similar preferences for certain items will also have similar preferences for other items.

### Content-Based Filtering

Content-based filtering is a method of recommending items to users based on the similarity of the items' attributes to the user's past behavior or preferences. This method relies on the assumption that users will prefer items that are similar to those they have liked in the past.

### Hybrid Filtering

Hybrid filtering combines collaborative and content-based filtering to provide recommendations to users. This method attempts to overcome the limitations of each approach by leveraging their strengths.

## Solutions Used in this Project

In this project, I used a content-based filtering approach to develop a basic recommender system. I generated embeddings for each movie overview using a pre-trained DistilBERT model, and then used cosine similarity to find movies with the closest embeddings to the user's input.



This approach has the advantage of being able to make recommendations based on the content of the items (i.e. the movie overviews), rather than relying on user behavior or preferences. However, it may not be as effective as collaborative filtering methods for recommending items that are outside of the user's usual preferences.

For the IMDb classifier, I fine-tuned a DistilBERT model on a dataset of movie overviews and their corresponding genres. I used a multi-label classification approach to account for the fact that movies can belong to multiple genres.

Overall, the models achieved reasonable accuracy, and the recommender system was able to generate recommendations based on user input. However, there is certainly room for improvement in both the classifier and the recommender, and there are many other approaches and techniques that could be explored to improve their performance.
